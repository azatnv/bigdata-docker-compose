"ACKBAR"	"You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor."
"MON MOTHMA"	"The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star."
"DODONNA"	"Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station."
"OFFICER CASS"	"Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems."
"FIXER"	"I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here.  I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system.  Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing..."
"SECOND OFFICER"	"Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!  And no transmissions were made.  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard."
"GENERAL MADINE"	"We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator."
"EMPEROR"	"Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends."
"REBEL CAPTAIN"	"Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the  speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch."
"TAGGE"	"Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  They're more dangerous than you realize."
"VOICE"	"We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley."
"NINEDENINE"	"You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely."
"DEATH STAR CONTROLLER"	"The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed."
"HAN/PILOT"	"It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit."
"DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE"	"We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet."
"TARKIN"	"You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.  This had better work."
"RIEEKAN"	"With all the meteor activity in this  system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships."
"REBEL OFFICER"	"We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah...  This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission."
"ASTRO-OFFICER"	"We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader.  But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!"
"CREATURE"	"Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat.  Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?"
"IMPERIAL OFFICER"	"The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.  What course shall we set?"
"DERLIN"	"Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The  shield doors must be closed."
"CONTROL OFFICER"	"Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals.  Enemy fighters coming your way."
"ANAKIN"	"You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right."
"BASE VOICE"	"His computer's off.  Luke, you switched off your targeting computer.  What's wrong?"
"VADER"	"Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen."
"MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE"	"The Death Star has cleared the planet.  The Death Star has cleared the planet."
"CAPTAIN"	"Hold your fire.  There are no life forms.  It must have been short-circuited."
"BIGGS"	"Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster."
"BERU"	"Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce."
"BARTENDER"	"Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here."
"THREEPIO"	"been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! "

"DECK OFFICER"	"Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first  marker."
"DACK"	"Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself."
"GREEDO"	"You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship."
"SENIOR CONTROLLER"	"No. Wait -- there's something very weak coming  through."
"BOBA FETT"	"What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me."
"NEEDA"	"Track them,. They may come around for another pass."
