"ACKBAR"	"You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor."
"MON MOTHMA"	"The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star."
"GENERAL MADINE"	"We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator."
"EMPEROR"	"Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends."
"NINEDENINE"	"You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely."
"DEATH STAR CONTROLLER"	"The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed."
"HAN/PILOT"	"It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit."
"BEN"	"Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor."
"ANAKIN"	"You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right."
"VADER"	"Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen."
"LUKE"	"Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict."
"OFFICER"	"Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived."
"PIETT"	"Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?"
"CONTROLLER"	"We have you on our screen now. Please identify."
"LANDO"	"You won't get another chance at this, Admiral."
"CONTROL ROOM COMMANDER"	"Send three squads to help. Open the back door."
"PILOT VOICE"	"Parts and technical crew for the forest moon."
"WEDGE"	"You'll make it. Just follow me Gold Leader."
"SCOUT #1"	"Go get your ride and take her back to base."
"JABBA"	"Your mind powers will not work on me, boy."
"RED THREE"	"Three of them coming in, twenty degrees!"
"OOLA"	"Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota..."
"RED LEADER"	"I get no reading. Are you sure?"
"GUARD"	"The Emperor will see you, now."
"JERJERROD"	"We shall double our efforts."
"SHUTTLE CAPTAIN"	"We're starting our approach."
"SCOUT"	"Look! Over there! Stop him!"
"BUNKER COMMANDER"	"Bring those two down here!"
"GREEN LEADER"	"Green Leader standing by."
"REBEL PILOT"	"There's too many of them!"
"SCOUT #l"	"Freeze!  Come on, get up!"
"GRAY LEADER"	"Gray Leader standing by."
"PILOT #2"	"Get him off of there!"
"STRANGE VOICE"	"Tee chuta hhat yudd!"
"NAVIGATOR"	"Pressure's steady."
"VOICE"	"I'm with you, too!"
"YODA"	"Your father he is."
"PILOT"	"Copy, Gold Leader."
"LURE"	"But you'll die."
"COMMANDER"	"Yes, my Lord."
"LEIA"	"Your father?"
"BIB"	"Nudd Chaa."
"OPERATOR"	"Yes, sir."
"HAN"	"You, too."
"SECOND COMMANDER"	"Yes, sir."
"STORMTROOPER"	"Let's go!"
"SCOUT #2"	"Yes, sir."
"Y-WING PILOT"	"I'm hit!"
"BOUSHH"	"Zeebuss."
"RED TWO"	"Got it!"
"WALKER PILOT #1"	"Look!"
"HAN and LUKE"	"Leia!"
