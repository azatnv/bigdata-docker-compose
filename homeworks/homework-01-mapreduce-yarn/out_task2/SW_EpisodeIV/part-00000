"JABBA"	"Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life."
"OFFICER CASS"	"Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems."
"DODONNA"	"Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station."
"FIXER"	"I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here.  I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system.  Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing..."
"SECOND OFFICER"	"Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!  And no transmissions were made.  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard."
"TAGGE"	"Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  They're more dangerous than you realize."
"VOICE"	"We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley."
"DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE"	"We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet."
"TARKIN"	"You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.  This had better work."
"ASTRO-OFFICER"	"We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader.  But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!"
"REBEL OFFICER"	"We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah...  This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission."
"IMPERIAL OFFICER"	"The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.  What course shall we set?"
"CONTROL OFFICER"	"Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals.  Enemy fighters coming your way."
"BASE VOICE"	"His computer's off.  Luke, you switched off your targeting computer.  What's wrong?"
"MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE"	"The Death Star has cleared the planet.  The Death Star has cleared the planet."
"CAPTAIN"	"Hold your fire.  There are no life forms.  It must have been short-circuited."
"MAN"	"All flight troops, man your stations.  All flight troops, man your stations."
"BIGGS"	"Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster."
"BERU"	"Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce."
"BARTENDER"	"Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here."
"THREEPIO"	"been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! "
"GANTRY OFFICER"	"Take over.  We've got a bad transmitter.  I'll see what I can do."
"CHIEF"	"This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?"
"VOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM"	"Clear Bay twenty-three-seven.  We are opening the magnetic field."
"GREEDO"	"You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship."
"INTERCOM VOICE"	"Who is this?  What's your operating number?"
"RED LEADER"	"We're passing through their magnetic field."
"OWEN"	"You must understand I need you here, Luke."
"CAMIE"	"It was just Wormie on another rampage."
"WILLARD"	"You're safe!  We had feared the worst."
"LEIA"	"to take the responsibility yourself!"
"TECHNICIAN"	"We'll get to work on him right away."
"LUKE"	"around forever trying to find them."
"MOTTI"	"We've entered the Alderaan system."
"FIRST TROOPER"	"Take over!See to him!  Look there!"
"WOMAN"	"I've told you kids to slow down!"
"TROOPER"	"You can go about your business."
"VADER"	"Your powers are weak, old man."
"GOLD TWO"	"The guns... they've stopped!"
"CREATURE"	"Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?"
"FIRST OFFICER"	"Follow me!  You stand guard."
"RED TEN"	"You'd better let her loose."
"GOLD FIVE"	"They came from behind...."
"CHIEF PILOT"	"There goes another one."
"RED ELEVEN"	"Red Eleven standing by."
"HAN"	"You're all clear, kid."
"DEAK"	"Not again!  Forget it."
"RED SEVEN"	"Red Seven standing by."
"WEDGE"	"What about that tower?"
"RED NINE"	"Red Nine standing by."
"AUNT BERU"	"Where are you going?"
"PORKINS"	"Red Six standing by."
"TROOPER VOICE"	"Open up in there!"
"GOLD LEADER"	"We're too close."
"HUMAN"	"You'll be dead."
"SECOND TROOPER"	"What was that?"
"COMMANDER"	"you anything."
"BEN"	"looking for."
"OFFICER"	"Yes, sir."
"WINGMAN"	"Yes, sir."
